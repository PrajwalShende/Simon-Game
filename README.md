# Simon-Game
Welcome to the Simon Game repository! Simon is a classic memory game that tests your ability to remember and repeat patterns.
Simon will produce a series of random signals (visual and auditory).
The player must repeat the same pattern by clicking on the buttons in the correct order.
If the player successfully repeats the sequence, Simon will add one more signal to the pattern.
If the player makes a mistake, the game ends, and their score is displayed.
The game gets progressively harder as the player successfully completes each level.
I used HTML,CSS and most importantly Javascript for this project.
